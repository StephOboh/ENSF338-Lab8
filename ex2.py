# 1. List two possible ways to implement this queue, with different efficiency (a slow one which uses linear search, and something faster) [0.2 pts]
'''
Slow Implementation using Linear Search:
In this approach, you maintain a list of unvisited vertices and iterate through the list to find the vertex with the minimum distance. 
This involves a linear search operation for each iteration, resulting in a time complexity of O(V^2) for the overall algorithm, 
where V is the number of vertices in the graph.

Faster Implementation using a Priority Queue (Heap):
Instead of using a list and linear search, you can utilize a priority queue, often implemented as a binary heap. 
This allows for efficient extraction of the vertex with the minimum distance in O(log V) time complexity. 
By using a priority queue, the overall time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm can be reduced to O((V + E) log V), where E is the number of edges in the graph. 
This is typically much faster than the linear search approach, especially for large graphs.
